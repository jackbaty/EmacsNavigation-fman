## What is it?

EmacsNavigation is a Plugin for [fman](https://fman.io/), my favorite filemanager.

## What does it do?

I wanted fman's keybindings to be more Emacs-like, so I created this plugin.

It adds Emacs-like keybindings for the basic navigation commands.

- `Ctrl+n` maps to MoveCursorUp
- `Ctrl+p` maps to MoveCursorDown

I just copied the [VimNavigation](https://github.com/raguay/VimNavigation/blob/master/vimnavigation/__init__.py) plugin and modified it to suit.
