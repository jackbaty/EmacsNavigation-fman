EmacsNavigation Plugin for fman

## What is it?

[fman](https://fman.io/) is my favorite filemanager.

I wanted the default keybindings to be more Emacs-like so I created this plugin.

## What does it do?

Maps basic navigation commands that will be familiar to Emacs users.

`Ctrl+n` maps to MoveCursorUp and `Ctrl+p` maps to MoveCursorDown.

I just copied the [VimNavigation](https://github.com/raguay/VimNavigation/blob/master/vimnavigation/__init__.py) plugin and modified it to suit.
